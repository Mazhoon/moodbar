TODO Amarok:

 * When storing moods with music, incremental scans are triggered 
   every time a moodbar is analyzed.  Make this not happen.

 * Scripting interface for e.g. full mood calcs
 * User-defined moodbar themes, plus one theme based on the kde 
   default colors
 * Moodbar column in flat view mode
 * Multiple moodbar processes
 * When playing a dynamic playlist minimized, calculate the moods
   of new songs that are added. (?)
